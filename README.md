# CryptoMagic
Encrypt and Decrypt the file that you have provided using C.


The utility has 2 command-line switches – they are “-E” for Encrypt and “-D” for Decrypt.
If none of these switches is specified, then encrypt is assumed
The utility also takes the name of an ASCII input file to encrypt/decrypt as an argument.
For example:
• cryptoMagic -E myFile.txt ← will encrypt the contents of the myFile.txt file
• cryptoMagic myFile.txt ← will encrypt the contents of the myFile.txt file
• cryptoMagic -D myFile.crp ← will decrypt the contents of the myFile.crp file
